Development Process
-------------------

My development process usually begins with a wireframe illustrating the project requirements. It is very important to plan how you will build your application before writing any code. Here is a series of steps I like to follow for each project:

<!-- Analyse project wireframe and understand domain requirements
Create README file with project documentation
Based on the wireframe, document all routes and API end points
Create a domain model
Go shopping - Select software stack and dependencies
Set up project repo and do necessary installations
Write database schema, and create database
Start Coding, Create Models and Collections
Write unit tests
Create Controllers and Library modules
Create Routes
Write integration tests
Create API
Review code and make adjustments where necessary
-->


Architecture 
--------------

My applications are heavily influenced by the MVC architecture which has served me well in my short Software Development career. The MVC architecture is well suited for Node.js development because it promotes modular code and separation of concerns.

Below is my typical directory structure.

/
 api/
 bin/
 collections/
 config/
 controllers/
 env/
 lib/
 models/
 public/
 routes/
 test/
 views/
 .gitignore
 .jshintrc
 app.js
 package.json
 README.md


Documentation (./README.md)
-----------------------------

The README.md is one of the most important files in my projects. I like to practice Readme Driven Development because I find it very effective for clarity and project direction.

My README.md file usually contains the following information:

Project title and description
Software requirement
Dependencies
Getting started instructions
Required configuration
Tasks commands
Style Guide
Application Architecture
Routes/API End Points
License information
